name: Build and Publish multi-arch image to GHCR

# This workflow builds multi-architecture container images for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, and linux/arm/v7.
# On push to 'main', it publishes images tagged as 'latest' and the commit SHA.
# On push of version tags (v*), it publishes images with the tag name.
# Images are published to ghcr.io under the repository owner's namespace.

# Trigger on pushes to main and on new tags
